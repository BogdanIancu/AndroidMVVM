# AndroidMVVM
An example of how to refactor a simple Android app from MVC to MVVM

<b>Please replace the api key with your own api key obtained from https://openweathermap.org/appid#get</b>

Look over the commits to see how the code was refactored from the default MVC implementation to a custom MVP implementation,
then to an MVP implementation that uses third party libraries (GSON, ButterKnife, Glide and Retrofit),
then to an MVVM app that is using binding and LiveData

<b>Enjoy!</b>
